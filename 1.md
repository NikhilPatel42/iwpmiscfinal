buffer

events
filesystem
http
modules:commonjs, packages
net
path
Query String
Stream
Timers
TLS/SSL (if using webCrypto API)
URL
webstreams api

"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon --inspect -e js, html, css, sql, app.js"
}

Current routing implementation(Incomplete, but enough for testing static pages)




Back-end outputs



Front-end tasks

Start with easy tasks, static pages
improvise and borrow ideas from related sites like monsterindia.com, and other sites.

use the router code given here to test the interconnectivity of various pages, all should be stored in the same directory.
steps:

1. https://scriptverse.academy/tutorials/nodejs-router.html
2. save as a js file
3. install node js on the terminal
4. type in "node <filename>.js"

Figure out static and dynamic content

- Static, all elements will be predeclared in the HTML file
- Dynamic, a script will load with the required elements on the basis of the backend response object(mostly json files in our case)

Static pages(somewhat): 
almost every static page involves forms.

Feedback page: most of the search bar menu with sort and filter fields
Admin page: Improvise here, should be a form with ability to block/delete users, employer profiles, etc
Home page: search bar, search filters (checkboxes, lists, options), (status of home page when no user has signed up)

User sign-up:
{
upload resume: [file] validate extension/MIME/file type
name
email
phone
location


--job related fields--

yoe (years of exp)
skills
industry
jobRole
}


Employer (Sign Up page)
{
name
email 
phone
locations: {} //array of locations - will be an array of locations currently looking for jobseekers in

}

steps
- validate with regex
- improvise on what else you can draw from similar sites

forms 
https://javascript.info/forms-controls

search bar
back end outputs (assume)
json file

for testing and development:
store a json file somewhere 
start nodejs and look at fetch apis for making tables, forms, etc.


look at the fetch api
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/fetch_api
https://javascript.info/network

an example 
https://howtocreateapps.com/fetch-and-display-json-html-javascript/

optional: animate progress
<progress> tag?

look at
- dom properties and methods to load in pages dynamically

Really just look throughout the site.

//interesting stuff

```js
let func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression;

let func = function(arg1, arg2, ..., argN) {
  return expression;
};
```

function f1(a, b, c) {
    if( f1.1(a) )
        f(b)
    else
        f(c)
}

f2(f1, b1, c1) {}
